# Compressors

Implementation of different compression algorithms in Go.
Mainly inspired by the [HTTP 203 episdoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZryHH8roIY) on compression, as well as this more in depth [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb7rzMxHyOk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJGErt5rrCqaSGTMyyqNt2H)

So far I have only implemented Huffman Encoding.
